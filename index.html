<!--
This is the HTML file for a simple game of Blackjack that is played in the browser.

The game is played by clicking on the "START GAME" button, which starts a new game of Blackjack.
The game state is displayed on the page, and the player can choose to draw a new card by clicking on the "NEW CARD" button.

The game state is stored in the following variables:

* "cards" is an array of the cards that have been drawn so far.
* "sum" is the total value of the cards that have been drawn.
* "hasBlackJack" is a boolean that is true if the player has a Blackjack (i.e. their cards have a total value of 21).
* "isAlive" is a boolean that is true if the game is still in progress.

The game state is updated whenever the player draws a new card or ends the game.

The game is rendered on the page by calling the "renderGame" function, which updates the HTML elements to reflect the current game state.
